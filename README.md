Codeology @ Berkeley, FA23 Internal Project

This contains the quick demos to AvoLingo, a translation web application made using HuggingFace's Transformers pipeline. To run the demo, go into the AvoLingo_demo.ipynb file and run each code block in order. This should produce a barebones version of the web application. Transformers_Attention.ipynb contains some explorational code project members went through to better understand the inner workings of transformers.
